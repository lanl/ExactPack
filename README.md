# ExactPack: An Open-Source Software Package for Code Verification

ExactPack (LA-CC-14-047) is an open-source software package that has been
developed for the verification & validation community. The package has two
major capabilities:

1. The generation of exact solutions for common benchmark problems in computational physics.
2. The analysis of computational physics code output to assess accuracy and convergence rates.

ExactPack is designed to be an open project, readily expandable to include new test problems for new physical models. At present, it contains the following modules and solutions (see reference list and documentation for details on these test problems):

* Hydrodynamics
  * Noh problem 
  * Sedov problem 
  * Several common shock tube problems (Sod, Einfeldt, Stationary Contact, Slow Shock, Shock Contact Shock, LeBlanc)
  * Shock tube problem with JWL equation of state
  * Guderley problem
* Reactive flows
  * Escape of high-explosive products
  * Programmed burn timing
  * Steady-detonation reaction-zone
  * Mader problem
  * Detonation Shock Dynamics problems (beta)
    * Rate stick
    * Cylindrical expansion
    * Explosive arc
* Inviscid hydrodynamics with heat transfer (radiation, conduction)
  * Coggeshall problems
  * Reinicke Meyer-ter-Vehn problem
  * Su-Olson problem
* Solid mechanics
  * Blake problem

The analysis capabilities of ExactPack include the import of data from computational physics codes, calculation of error norms between exact solutions and numerical results, and the calculation of spatial convergence rates. These tools follow the standards defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Installation
------------

The preferred method for installing ExactPack as a user is via the Anaconda python distribution's `conda install` command:

`conda install exactpack -c lanl-exactpack`

For developers, the repository may be cloned from the GitHub repository located at https://github.com/lanl/ExactPack, and installed using the usual command: `python setup.py install`. The following dependencies are required:

### Dependencies

Python dependencies:
* Python 2.7
* setuptools
* numpy
* sphinx
* matplotlib
* scipy

Other dependencies:
* C compiler
* Fortran compiler (must support quad-precision arithmetic, i.e. REAL*16)
* VTK

The built-in test suite may be run in a similar way: `python setup.py test`.

The online documentation may be compiled via Sphinx by moving to the doc directory within the Exactpack repository and using the command `make html`. This creates a build directory. The root file for this online documentation is located in `$EXACTPACK_ROOT/doc/build/html/index.html`, which may be opened in a web browser.
